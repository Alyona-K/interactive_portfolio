    "careerSwitch": {
      "question": "Why did I switch to IT and choose frontend development?",
      "answer": "Because I wanted a field where growth is unlimited and tied directly to how well I think and build. Frontend combines logic, interactivity, and visible impact — I write code and immediately see how it changes the user experience. That mix of structure + creativity feels like the right environment for me long-term."
    },
    "designBackground": {
      "question": "How does my design background help me as a developer?",
      "answer": "Years in design trained me to think in systems: components, patterns, user flows, visual hierarchy. Now I apply the same thinking in code — structuring features, keeping architecture clean, and making UI decisions that are both user-friendly and technically sound. It also makes me fast at spotting inconsistencies and UI issues before they become bugs."
    },
    "favoriteTasks": {
      "question": "What types of tasks excite me the most?",
      "answer": "Anything that requires combining engineering with interactivity: complex UIs, rendering optimization, animations, smooth flows, and logic-heavy components. I like tasks where the final result feels “alive” — not just layouts, but experiences."
    },
    "careerGoals": {
      "question": "What are my long-term career goals?",
      "answer": "To grow into a strong frontend engineer who: confidently works with large-scale architectures, deeply understands JavaScript and React internals, focuses on performance and DX, contributes to the product, not just to the codebase. And eventually — mentor others and help shape processes."
    },
    "teamEnvironment": {
      "question": "What kind of team and environment do I value?",
      "answer": "A team where communication is clear, expectations are transparent, and learning is normal — not something “extra”. I work best where people share knowledge openly, respect each other's time, and care about building things thoughtfully, not “just ship it”."
    },
    "motivation": {
      "question": "What drives me outside of tasks and technologies?",
      "answer": "Understanding why we build something and how it impacts users. I like looking at the product from the angle of systems thinking: how features connect, how decisions ripple through the whole codebase, and how small details affect the experience."
    }
